## If-Else Statements

[**If-Else Statements**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/if_else_statement_in_java.htm) are similar to if-statements but includes an **else** block which executes if the boolean expression evaluates to `false`.

Notice, when working with just If-statements, we had to include an if-statement for each possible outcome of our expression. Using an `else` statement, we can set a default statement to execute when the boolean is false.

## Input Validation

One good use of If-Else Statements is to validate user's input. You can check that the user entered a valid input then use that input in you program, or if they didn't you can display an error message. Later, we will learn how to loop back so the user can try to enter a valid response again.

## IF-Else Nesting

Just like with If-Statements, you can nest `if` and `if-else` Statements inside either the `if` scope or the `else` scope.
